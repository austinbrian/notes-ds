# Spatiotemporal data
---
We consider errors of a spatiotemporal model to be independent, conditional on the space and time terms in the model


### Modeling simplifications
*These are often somewhat unrealistic*

**Constant mean** - centered at zero (very similar to the way linear models calculate lines of best fit)

**Stationary** - a constant mean does *NOT* depend on space and time; the differences in points depends only on space and time, not on the actual points in space and time themselves

**Isotropy** - at a given distance, spatial direction does not matter

**Separability** - covariance in space is independent of the covariance in time
