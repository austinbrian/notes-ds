# Bayes' Rule
-----

The rule relates *P(A|B)* and *P(B|A)*
Start with the identity of an intersection between two things:
* *P(A* ∩ *B)*  = *P(B* ∩ *A)*
* So it doesn't matter what order you put these things, their intersection is their intersection.

Convert that to the expanded idea of that union for each.
*P(A|B)P(B)* = *P(B|A)P(A)*

And then "divide" by *P(B)*

*P(A|B)* = *P(B|A)P(A)* / *P(B)*

# Probability and Statistics
----

In probability, the *parameters* are known as the measures of the entire population

In statistics, we estimate the population by *calculating functions* of a sample; it will approximate the true value of the parameters

We gather a sample to learn about the population
We calculate statistics to learn about parameters
